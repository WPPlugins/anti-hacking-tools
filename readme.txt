Protect your blog from hacking tools, ircbot (botnet) and fake browser.

== Description ==

Too difficult to protect the site from botnets. googlebot, ybot, crawler bot is a botnet. 
RSS, feedback tool uses the same technique with a botnet. irc bot, bot scanner or a hacking 
tool that is also botnet. 
but has a different purpose. IRC bot, Bot scanner or a hacking tool is very disturbing, 
and its presence does not benefit us. from here the idea of making this Plugins.
if the medium and high risk tool will implement the web status refused. 
and if a low risk web status can only be read to apply, can not upload or comment.
Database on the plugin is taken from an existing tool.
I hope this tool is useful for security and do not interfere with your SEO.
